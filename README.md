## Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

To get started, clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linktree-templates.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP file of your favorite template directly from the repository.

### 2. Choose and Customize a Template

Navigate to the folder of the template you want to use. Each template comes with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are easy to modify.

- **HTML**: Edit the `index.html` file to change your username, profile image, description, and links.
- **CSS**: Modify the `styles.css` file to customize the colors, fonts, and overall appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Customize the `script.js` file if you want to adjust animations or dynamic elements like background stars or interactive buttons.

### 3. Customizing the Links

Each template comes with a section to add your own links. Update the links to point to your personal pages, social media, or any other content you want to share:

```html
<div class="links">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/yourprofile" class="button">Twitter</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/yourprofile" class="button">GitHub</a>
  <a href="https://portfolio.yourwebsite.com" class="button">Portfolio</a>
</div>
```

### 4. Upload Your Template to the Permaweb Using ArDrive

Once you have customized your template, you can upload it to the Permaweb for permanent hosting using [ArDrive](https://ardrive.ar.io/).

Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Sign up for ArDrive**: If you don‚Äôt already have an Arweave wallet, you can create one via ArDrive.
2. **Upload Your Files**: Use the ArDrive app to upload your template‚Äôs files, including the `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and any images (like your profile picture or favicon).
3. **Publish**: Once your files are uploaded, you will receive a URL pointing to your linktree page hosted on the Permaweb.

### 5. Get an ArNS Name for Your Linktree Page

To make your linktree easier to share, you can register an Arweave Name System (ArNS) name.

1. **Visit ArNS**: Head to [ArNS](https://arns.ar.io/) and register a name of your choice (e.g., `yourname.ar`).
2. **Point to Your Linktree Page**: Once registered, you can point your ArNS name to the Arweave transaction ID of your linktree page. This will make your page accessible via `https://yourname.ar`.

### 6. Share Your Linktree Page

After registering your ArNS name and publishing your page, you can start sharing your personalized linktree page with the world! Whether it's for your social media, portfolio, or business, your page will live forever on the Permaweb.
