# Minimalist Linktree

Welcome to the Minimalist Linktree! This theme offers a clean, simple, and professional design for your linktree page. It’s perfect for those who prefer a sleek, no-frills aesthetic. Follow the instructions below to customize your minimalist template.

## Key Features

- **Clean Design**: Simple, elegant layout with easy-to-read text and subtle styling.
- **Responsive**: The template is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Custom Scrollbar**: A minimalistic, custom scrollbar that enhances the clean aesthetic.
- **Custom Profile Picture**: A circular profile image for a professional and clean look.

## Customization Guide

### 1. Replace Profile Image and Favicon

- **Profile Image**: Swap out `default-avatar.png` with your own profile picture. The default size is 100x100 pixels, but you can adjust it to fit your style.
- **Favicon**: Replace `favicon.ico` with your own favicon for the browser tab.

### 2. Change Username and Description

- Modify the **h1** tag to reflect your name or brand.
- Edit the **p** tag to write a short description of yourself or the purpose of your page.

### 3. Modify Links

- The `a` tags in the **links** section represent the buttons for your external links. Update the `href` attributes to point to your social media profiles, content, or portfolio.
- You can customize the button text to match the purpose of the link (e.g., "LinkedIn", "GitHub", "Portfolio").

### 4. Customize Styling

- **Colors**: Adjust the colors by modifying the background-color and text-color properties in the `styles.css` file. The main areas to change are the body, button, and text styles.
- **Fonts**: Update the fonts by changing the `font-family` in the body and other text elements.
- **Scrollbar**: The minimalist custom scrollbar can be further modified by adjusting the colors or width in the `::-webkit-scrollbar` and related pseudo-classes.
- **Button Styling**: Customize the button size, hover effects, and padding by editing the `.button` class in the `styles.css` file.

### 5. Custom Scrollbar

- The page includes a minimalist scrollbar that matches the clean aesthetic. You can modify the colors or dimensions by adjusting the `::-webkit-scrollbar`, `::-webkit-scrollbar-track`, and `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` classes in CSS.

## Advanced Customizations

- **Box Shadows**: To give the design a subtle 3D effect, you can modify the `box-shadow` property in the `.container` or button styles.
- **Button Animations**: Add simple hover animations by adjusting the `transition` property in the `.button:hover` class.
- **Profile Picture Styling**: Change the border radius, size, or shadow of the profile picture to fit your aesthetic.
