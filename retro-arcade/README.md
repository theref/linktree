# Retro Arcade Linktree

Welcome to the Retro Arcade Linktree! This theme adds a fun, dynamic, and nostalgic arcade-style vibe to your linktree page, with pixelated avatars, neon glows, and retro animations. Follow the instructions below to make this retro template your own.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Neon Glow**: Glowing buttons, headers, and borders that pulse with retro energy.
- **Arcade Sound Effects**: Add retro sound effects like a "coin insert" on hover.
- **Falling Pixels**: An animated background of falling pixels to mimic an arcade game screen.
- **Custom Retro Avatar**: A pixelated, 8-bit style avatar to match the arcade theme.
- **Score Counter**: A fun, interactive score counter that tracks button clicks like an arcade game.

## Customization Guide

### 1. Replace Profile Image and Favicon

- **Profile Image**: Swap out `arcade-avatar.png` with your own avatar that fits the retro style. The avatar should be 100x100 pixels.
- **Favicon**: Replace `favicon.ico` with your own custom favicon to show in the browser tab.

### 2. Change Username and Description

- Update the **h1** tag to reflect your own username (e.g., "Player 1" or any retro-inspired name you prefer).
- Modify the **p** tag in the `arcade-desc` class to write a fun, retro-themed description about yourself or your page.

### 3. Modify Links

- The `a` tags inside the **links** section represent the buttons for your external links. You can edit the `href` attributes to point to your social media, portfolio, or any other content.
- Customize the button labels to something fun and arcade-like (e.g., "ðŸ•¹ Level 1" could be "LinkedIn" or "GitHub").

### 4. Add Arcade Sound Effects

- By default, thereâ€™s a "coin insert" sound effect on button hover. Replace the `coin-insert.mp3` file with your own sound effect for a personalized arcade feel.

### 5. Customize Styling

- **Colors**: Modify the neon glow colors, button backgrounds, or text by editing the values in the `styles.css` file. Look for the `.arcade-frame`, `.arcade-button`, and `.arcade-header` classes for the main elements.
- **Glows**: Change the intensity or color of the glowing elements by adjusting the `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` properties in CSS.
- **Falling Pixels**: The `pixel` class controls the falling pixels in the background. Change the color or animation speed for a different effect.
- **Scrollbar**: You can customize the retro-style scrollbar by editing the `::-webkit-scrollbar` and related pseudo-classes.

### 6. Score Counter

- The score counter dynamically updates every time a user clicks a button. This is controlled in `script.js`. If you want to reset or modify how the score works, adjust the JavaScript accordingly.

## Advanced Customizations

- **Retro Boot-Up Effect**: The page includes a boot-up screen animation before loading the main content. Customize the loading text or duration by editing the JavaScript in `script.js`.
- **Easter Eggs**: Consider adding a secret key combination like the "Konami Code" to trigger hidden effects or colors on your linktree.
